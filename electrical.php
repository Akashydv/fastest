			The growth in the demand for telecom products has been breathtaking, and it is expected that 118 million smartphones will be sold in India this year! With telecom penetration of around 10 percent, this growth is expected to continue, at least over the next decade. Penetration levels in other high growth products are equally high and the growth in demand for Computer/ IT products, auto electronics, medical, industrial, as well as consumer electronics is equally brisk. Combined with low penetration levels and the Indian economy growing at an impressive 7% per annum, the projection of a US$ 150 Billion market is quite realistic and offers an excellent opportunity to electronics players worldwide. While the Electronics sector in India is currently establishing its global role, there are several advantages that India offers that can be effectively leveraged to achieve higher growth: Manpower, Market Demand, and Policy and Regulatory Support.<br><br>

			<br>The Major challenges that the Indian electronic manufacturing market is facing are infrastructure, which needs to be improved at the earliest, easing of foreign investment procedures (which is underway), and a restructured government tariff that now makes domestically manufactured goods more expensive than imported goods with zero tariffs.</p>
