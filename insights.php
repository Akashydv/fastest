 <h1>Outplacement</h1>
 <p>Outplacement is a support service provided by some organizations to help former employees transition to new jobs. A consultancy firm usually provides the outplacement services which are paid for by the former employer and are achieved usually through practical advice, training materials and workshops.The implementation of a carefully structured support service by experienced professionals is essential to maintain an organisation’s reputation as a considerate employer of choice and to reduce potential.
 <br>Outplacement is either delivered through individual one-on-one sessions or in a group format. Topics include career guidance, career evaluation, job search skills, targeting the job market, resume writing, interview preparation, developing networks, and negotiation
 <br>Outplacement provides former employees structure and guidance towards their new career option, and preserves the morale of those who remain in the Company who see that colleagues are given the necessary support when they leave the company.
 <br>The best outplacement programs provide ongoing support, as it is often the case that after the individual has not been able to find a new job after searching for a number of weeks that they need the most help. Many companies will stop providing support after an allotted time although some companies provide support for as long as the individual needs it.Some also track the success rate of re-employment to help evaluate services.</p>

<p>Whether you are looking to hire a chef, developers, or any other employee, it is important to be flexible to get better outcomes from your candidates and employees. This is the reason a flexible staffing technique can serve your association’s needs with better ROI. 
We started with detailed strategic planning and setup of a proper governance system market to run a successful hiring program. Our initial steps were Market Intelligence & Talent Mapping. This initial phase took us almost 2 weeks, but it ensured we got a head start on hiring both in terms of candidate engagement & planning.</p>
