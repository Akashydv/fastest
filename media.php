			The media and entertainment industry in India consists of many different segments under its folds such as television, print, and films. It also includes smaller segments like radio, music, out-of-home advertising, animation, gaming[disambiguation needed] and visual effects (VFX) and internet advertising. The entertainment industry in India has registered explosive growth in the last two decades making it one of the fastest-growing industries in India. From a single state-owned channel, Doordarshan in the 1990s there are more than 400 active channels in the country. Worldwide, 2010 saw the global economy begin to recover from a steep decline in 2009.<br>

			<br>While India was not critically impacted by the downturn in 2008 and 2009, it demonstrated one of the highest growth rates this year and continued to at a healthy pace. The rising rate of investments by the private sector and foreign media and entertainment (M&E) majors have improved India's entertainment infrastructure to a great extent. As per the recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Indians are likely to spend more on entertainment in the coming years with steady growth in their disposable income.
